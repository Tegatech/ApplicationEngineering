## Future updates and Challenges
#### Drag and Drop
I was unable to create drag and drop to work in the way and thus I left it out - I will continue to work on this after submission

#### Saving
Created a button for users to save text which will create a list and then users can drag and drop into the text div. Users will be able to see there saved Texts in the "Saved Text" section and will be able to Edit and Delete. I will continue to work on this after submission -- Button is not working
